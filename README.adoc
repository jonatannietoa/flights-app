= Flights App

== Getting started

To use this app, you need to register an [appId] and [appKey] on the
https://developer.flightstats.com service.

You can create an `application-secrets.properties` in `src/main/resources` and add your
API key there:

```

#Database Secrets
spring.datasource.password=<yourpass>

#FlightStats Secrets
flightstats.api.appId=<yourid>
flightstats.api.appKey=<yourkey>

```

TIP: The `application-secrets.properties` file is referenced in the `.gitignore` of the
project so you won't commit it by mistake.
